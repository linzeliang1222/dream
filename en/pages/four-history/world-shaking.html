                        united the Chinese people and led them in achieving a great leap from standing up to becoming

                            <p>How to combine the national conditions and explore China's own road of socialist
                                construction in an economically and culturally backward country is a very difficult
                                matter. Since it's exploration, there will be mistakes. After 1958, the Party began to
                                make mistakes, even serious ones, including the great Leap Forward, setbacks in the
                                movement of people's communes and the cultural Revolution, which affected the whole
                                situation for ten years. Faced with the serious consequences caused by the "left"
                                mistakes, our Party has undergone profound reflection. During an inspection tour to
                                Northeast China from September 16 to 18, 1978, Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "If socialism
                                is to demonstrate its superiority, how can it be that after more than 20 years of
                                development, people are still so poor? Why should socialism be used?" On December 13 of
                                the same year, he delivered an important speech at the Central Work Conference. This is
                                the famous article titled "Emancipate the Mind, Seek truth from Facts, Unite and look
                                forward". He stressed, If we do not carry out reform now, our modernization and
                                socialist cause will be destroyed. In fact, this speech became the keynote report of the
                                third Plenary Session of the eleventh Central Committee of the COMMUNIST Party of China,
                                and became a manifesto for emancipating the mind and seeking truth from facts in the new
                                era.</p>
                            <p>The third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee in 1978 marked a turning
