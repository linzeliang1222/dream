                        The century-old Party is in its prime. 2021 marks the 100th anniversary of the founding of the
                        CPC! Let us relive the journey of the CPC's 100th anniversary, feel the magnificent epic
                        chapter, and draw wisdom and strength from the history of the Party!

                            <p>In the early days of the founding of the People's Republic of China, the situation at
                                home and abroad was extremely difficult and complicated. As a result of the long war,
                                the domestic economy was ruined and the people were destitute. Kuomintang remnants wait
                                for an opportunity to destroy, banditry is serious. Some areas have not yet been
                                liberated, and many grass-roots units have not yet established political power. The
                                West, led by the United States, isolates us politically, blockades us economically and
                                threatens us militarily. On June 25, 1950, the Korean Civil War broke out, followed by
                                the U.S. invasion of Korea and the invasion of the Taiwan Strait by the 7th Fleet. The
                                new People's Republic of China is under grave security threat. "One punch at a time,
                                before all the blows come." After full discussion and comprehensive consideration, the
                                CPC Central Committee and Chairman MAO Zedong made the strategic decision of "fighting
                                the United States and aiding Korea and protecting our country". The war of resistance to
                                the United States and Aid to Korea played the national prestige of new China, improved
                                the prestige of the Communist Party of China in the people of the whole country,
                                improved the national confidence and national pride of the Chinese people, maintained
                                the peace of Asia and the world, new China stood firm. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping later
                                said, with the founding of the People's Republic of China, "China obtained one
                                qualification: people dare not look down upon us".</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>Similarly, how to build socialism and how to promote China's modernization was also a
                                completely new topic for the Communist Party of China when new China was founded. From
                                learning from the Soviet Union to "taking the Soviet Union as a mirror", the CPC began
                                to explore China's own path of socialist construction. In 1956, China's socialist
                                transformation was completed, the basic socialist system was established, and socialist
                                construction began on a large scale, making great achievements. In June 1954, Comrade
                                MAO Zedong asked: "What can we build now? You can make tables and chairs, you can make
                                tea bowls and teapots, you can grow food, you can grind it into flour, you can make
                                paper, but not a car, not a plane, not a tank, not a tractor." Under the strong
                                leadership of the COMMUNIST Party of China and through the self-reliance and hard work
                                of the Chinese people, we soon achieved countless firsts in Chinese history. Produce the
                                first plane, the first car, first tractor, developed by the first atomic bomb and
                                hydrogen bomb has exploded, planes to develop its first man-made earth satellite launch,
                                successfully developed the first atomic submarine launching, designed to build the first
                                bridge, the nanjing Yangtze river bridge, synthetic bovine insulin, for the first time
                                in the world The first successful cultivation of strong advantage indica hybrid rice.
                                After more than 20 years of hard work, an independent and relatively complete industrial
                                system and national economic system have been initially established. Deng Xiaoping once
                                said, "If China had not had atomic bombs or hydrogen bombs or launched satellites since
                                the 1960s, China would not be a major country with important influence and would not
                                have the international status it has now." During this period, China also preliminarily
                                solved the problem of feeding and dressing hundreds of millions of people, which was
                                also recognized as a miracle of the world at that time.</p>

                            </p>
                            <p>In those passionate years, the whole Party maintained a good spirit and the whole society
                                formed a good social conduct, which was transformed into a powerful force for advancing
                                socialist revolution and construction. Comrade Wang Jinxi, a worker in Daqing, shouted,
                                "If oil workers roar, the earth should shake three times." The iron man spirit has
                                brought unforgettable impression, memory and moving to the people of the whole country,
                                inspiring and inspiring the people of the whole country to brave hardships and march
                                forward bravely. The story of people in Linxian county, Henan province, cutting through
                                mountains of Taihang mountains with simple tools and channelling water from Zhang River
                                into Linxian county to build the red Flag Canal, an artificial river of heaven, is an
                                epitome of the Chinese people's hard work at this time.
                            </p>
                            <p>The socialist revolution and the establishment of the basic socialist system were a great
                                endeavor in which the Party's first generation of central collective leadership with
                                Comrade MAO Zedong at its core united the whole Party and the people of all ethnic
                                groups in China and led them in making a great endeavor. They reflected the will of the
                                Chinese people, were in line with China's realities and followed the trend of historical
                                development. The most extensive and profound social transformation in the history of the
                                Chinese nation has laid down the fundamental political premise and institutional
                                foundation for all development and progress in contemporary China, and provided valuable
                                experience, theoretical preparation and material foundation for the creation of
                                socialism with Chinese characteristics.</p>
                            <p>During the new-democratic revolution, socialist revolution and construction period, the
                                COMMUNIST Party of China united and led the Chinese people in making a great leap from
                                "the sick man of East Asia" to standing up.</p>
