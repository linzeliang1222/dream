                        The Communist Party of China has accumulated valuable experience in its century-old history,
                        which is precious and can be summarized as follows.
                        <div class="copyright mt20">
                            <p>1. We must uphold Party leadership over all work. China's modern history shows that
                                without the COMMUNIST Party there would be no New China, and without the Communist Party
                                there would be no socialism with Chinese characteristics. General Secretary Xi Jinping
                                has pointed out that "the Party leads everything in the party, government, military and
                                people's studies, east, west, north and South." The most essential feature of socialism
                                with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the COMMUNIST Party of China. The
                                greatest strength of the system of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the
                                leadership of the Communist Party of China, and the Party is the highest force for
                                political leadership. We must resolutely uphold the authority and centralized, unified
                                leadership of the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, improve
                                systems and mechanisms for upholding overall Party leadership, and enhance the Party's
                                ability and resolve to set the direction, plan for the overall situation, formulate
                                policies, and promote reform.</p>

                            <p>2. We must uphold the guiding position of Marxism. The Communist Party of China is a
                                proletarian political party established under the guidance of Marxism. Marxism is the
                                ideological and spiritual banner of the Party. General Secretary Xi Jinping has pointed
                                out that "Marxism is the fundamental guiding ideology for building the Party and the
                                country. If we deviate from or abandon Marxism, our Party will lose its soul and its
                                direction." We must integrate the basic tenets of Marxism with China's reality and the
                                characteristics of The Times, constantly adapt Marxism to Chinese conditions, arm the
                                whole Party with the Party's innovative theories, educate the people, and constantly
                                open up new horizons for Marxism in contemporary China and in the 21st century.</p>

                            <p>3. We must adhere to the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics. Direction
                                determines our future, and our path determines our destiny. As General Secretary Xi
                                Jinping has pointed out, "Socialism with Chinese characteristics did not fall from the
                                sky. It is a fundamental achievement made by the Party and the people through untold
                                hardships and enormous costs. Socialism with Chinese characteristics is not only a great
                                cause we must continue to advance, but also a fundamental guarantee for our future." We
                                must unswervingly stay on the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, and
                                neither follow the old path of isolation and ossification, nor follow the evil path of
                                abandoning the banner and becoming an independent school.</p>

                            <p>4. We must continue to put the people first. The Communist Party of China has no
                                interests of its own, still less special interests, except those of the working class
                                and the overwhelming majority of the people. As Xi Jinping has pointed out, "The people
                                are the biggest source of confidence for our Party to govern, the solid foundation of
                                our Republic, and the foundation for us to strengthen the Party and rejuvenate the
                                country." Our Party comes from the people, works for the people, and thrives on them. We
                                must always have one heart and soul with the people, share weal and woe with them, and
                                work with them in unity. We must adhere to the fundamental purpose of serving the people
                                wholeheartedly, implement the mass line, respect the principal position of the people
                                and their initiative, and always maintain close ties with the people. We must build a
                                mighty force that inspires unity, and unite and lead the people in jointly creating
                                historic undertakings.</p>

                            <p>5. The Party must continue to give top priority to development in governing and
                                rejuvenating the country. Poverty is not socialism. It is the essential requirement of
                                socialism to liberate and develop the productive forces and enhance the comprehensive
                                national strength of a socialist country. As Xi Jinping has pointed out, "Development is
                                the foundation and the key to solving all problems in China." We must adhere to the new
                                vision of development, take promoting high-quality development as the theme, build a
                                modernized economy, and lay a strong material foundation for socialism with Chinese
                                characteristics.</p>

                            <p>6.We must continue to deepen reform and opening up. Reform and opening-up is the source
                                of vitality for contemporary China's development and progress. It is an important weapon
                                for the Party and the people to make great strides to keep up with the pace of The
                                Times, and the only way to uphold and develop socialism with Chinese characteristics. As
                                Xi Jinping has pointed out, "Reform and opening-up is a great new revolution carried out
                                by the people under the leadership of our Party in the new era. It is the most
                                distinctive feature of contemporary China and the most distinctive banner of our Party."
                                Reform and opening up is only in progress, but never finished. We need to deepen our
                                understanding of and application of the laws governing reform and opening-up, strengthen
                                our resolve, strengthen our courage, and unswervingly carry it through to the end.</p>

                            <p>7. We must uphold democratic centralism. Democratic centralism is the fundamental
                                organizational principle of Marxist political parties. Our Party has enriched and
                                developed the content of democratic centralism in its long-term practice, making it a
                                unique leading and working system of the Party. As Xi Jinping has pointed out,
                                "Democratic centralism is the fundamental organizational principle and leadership system
                                of our Party, and an important mark that distinguishes A Marxist party from other
                                political parties." Under the new circumstances, we must uphold this fundamental
                                organizational principle and maintain and give full play to the Party's greatest
                                institutional advantage.</p>

                            <p>8. We must adhere to scientific, democratic and law-based governance. Scientific,
                                democratic and law-based governance is a governance mode suited to China's national
                                conditions that has been explored and formed by the CPC in its long-term practice of
                                governance. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: "Must adapt to the national
                                modernization process, improve the level of scientific ruling, democratic ruling, ruling
                                in accordance with the law, improving national institutions started their ability,
                                improve the people to manage state affairs according to law, economic social and
                                cultural affairs, the ability of their own affairs, party, state and social affairs
                                management institutionalized, standardization, sequencing, We will continue to improve
                                our ability to effectively govern the country with the socialist system with Chinese
                                characteristics." We must continue to develop and improve the Party's scientific and
                                effective form of governance.</p>

                            <p>9. We must uphold socialist ideology. The guiding position of Marxism in the field of
                                ideology is the ideological foundation for the concerted struggle of the whole Party and
                                the Chinese people. General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: "To do publicity and
                                ideological work well under the new situation, we must consciously assume the mission of
                                raising the flag, gathering the people's support, educating new people, revitalizing
                                culture and developing our image." We must firmly cultural self-confidence, adhere to
                                the socialist core values guide cultural construction, vigorously carry forward the
                                national spirit with patriotism as the core and with reform and innovation as the core
                                spirit of The Times to strengthen the construction of socialist spiritual civilization,
                                for all-round construction of socialism modernization country provide a powerful
                                ideological guarantee and strong cultural support.</p>

                            <p>10. We must uphold the Party's absolute leadership over the people's armed forces. Having
                                a strong army and consolidating national defense are the basic conditions for the
                                proletarian party to seize power and stay in power for a long time. General Secretary Xi
                                Jinping has pointed out that "building a people's army that listens to the Party's
                                command, can fight and win, and maintains a fine style of conduct is strategic support
                                for realizing the two Centenary Goals and realizing the great rejuvenation of the
                                Chinese nation." Our army was conceived and developed under the leadership of the Party.
                                Upholding the Party's absolute leadership over the armed forces is the eternal soul of
                                the armed forces and the fundamental guarantee for the Party's long-term governance and
                                the country's long-term peace and stability. We will unswervingly follow the path of
                                strengthening the armed forces with Chinese characteristics, strengthen them through
                                political work, reform, science and technology, talent, and law-based governance,
                                comprehensively modernize national defense and the armed forces, and build the people's
                                armed forces into world-class forces.</p>

                            <p>11. We must continue to consolidate and develop the broadest possible patriotic united
                                front. The united front is an important magic weapon of the CPC. To establish a united
                                front, achieve the broadest political solidarity, expand the social base and unite all
                                forces that can be united is a successful experience for the CPC to achieve victory in
                                various historical periods. As General Secretary Xi Jinping has pointed out, "The united
                                front has never been built for the sake of looking good or sounding good, but because it
                                is useful, useful and indispensable. In the final analysis, the united front is the work
                                of being a human being, and the united front is to build up the strength to work
                                together." We should continue to develop and strengthen the patriotic united front for
                                the new era, promote harmonious relations between political parties, ethnic groups,
                                religions, social strata, and compatriots at home and abroad, seek the greatest common
                                ground, draw the greatest circle of concentric circles, and add strong strength to the
                                reunification of the motherland and the realization of the Chinese dream of national
                                rejuvenation.</p>

                            <p>12.We must continue to advance the lofty cause of peace and development for mankind. The
                                COMMUNIST Party of China (CPC) is a party that strives for the happiness of the Chinese
                                people and the progress of mankind. The CPC has always taken it as its mission to make
                                new and greater contributions to mankind. General Secretary Xi Jinping has pointed out,
                                "All the CPC does is to seek happiness for the Chinese people, rejuvenation for the
                                Chinese nation, and peace and development for mankind." We will raise the banner of
                                peace, development and cooperation, win-win, adhere to grasp the world development
                                trend, always stand in the tide of development, unswervingly pursue the road of peaceful
                                development, unswervingly pursue the win-win strategy of opening up, adhere to promote
                                the building new international relationships, promote to build human destiny community,
                                strengthen the friendly exchanges with other countries, and people from all around the
                                We will continue to advance the lofty cause of peace and development for mankind.</p>

                            <p>13. We must comprehensively govern the Party with strict discipline. The greatness of the
                                COMMUNIST Party of China does not lie in never making mistakes, but in never avoiding
                                medical problems, facing up to problems and having the courage to make self-revolution.
                                General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out: "To forge iron, one must be strong. The key to
                                running China's affairs lies in the Party, and the key lies in the party's efforts to
                                supervise and comprehensively govern it with strict discipline." The fundamental reason
                                why the CPC has come to the fore amid repeated contests among various political forces
                                in modern China is that it has always maintained the spirit of self-revolution, taken up
                                the scalpel again and again to correct its own ills and solved its own problems on its
                                own. If our Party is to remain qualified to lead a great social revolution, it must have
                                the courage to carry out a great self-revolution, constantly enhance its capacity for
                                self-purification, self-improvement, self-innovation, and self-improvement, and always
                                maintain its advanced nature and purity. We need to improve our ability to manage the
                                Party, advance the great new project of Party building, and make the Party even
                                stronger.</p>
                            <p>The Communist Party of China is determined to achieve great things in the future. The
                                centenary is in its prime. Looking back at history, we are proud; Looking ahead, our
                                hearts swell. History moves from yesterday to today and then to tomorrow, and the ties
                                between history cannot be cut off. In the century since its founding, the COMMUNIST
                                Party of China has united and led the Chinese people to create historical glory. The
                                achievements of the CPC today have provided the premise, created the conditions and laid
                                the foundation for greater achievements tomorrow. Staying true to its original
                                aspiration, keeping its mission firmly in mind, and working hard all the time, the CPC
                                will surely write new chapters and create new and greater achievements in the centenary
                                of its governance, that is, the centenary of the founding of the People's Republic of
                                China. History has created the CPC through the people's exploration and struggle, and
                                the CPC has united and led the people to create historical glory. "If you look at
                                history, you will see the future." To review the century-old history of the CPC, we
                                should strengthen the CPC's confidence in its history, and at the same time, strengthen
                                the confidence of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation in the future.</p>
