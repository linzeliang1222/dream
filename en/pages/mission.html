                        According to the report of the 19th CPC National Congress, the original aspiration and mission
                        of the CPC is to seek happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation.
                        Throughout the history of the CPC, whether in good times or bad, it has always pursued its
                        original mission of "seeking happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese
                        nation." In different historical periods, the party's original aspiration and mission have
                        different historical connotations.

                            <h1>1. The Initial mission of the CPC in its early years</h1>
                            <p>In February 1848, The Communist Manifesto drafted by Marx and Engels came out, which was
                                a program for the communist League, the world's first proletarian political party,
                                marking the birth of Marxism. Marx and Engels pointed out in the Communist Manifesto,
                                "All movements in the past were of or for the benefit of minorities. The proletarian
                                movement is the independent movement of the great majority, for the good of the great
                                majority." "The Communists are not a special party in opposition to other workers'
                                parties." "They have no interests distinct from those of the proletariat as a whole."
                                "In place of the old bourgeois society, in which class and class antagonism existed,
                                there is such a union, in which the free development of each is the condition for the
                                free development of all." Marx and Engels declared to the world in the form of programs
                                and declarations that it is the original aspiration and mission of the Communist Party
                                to uphold the position of the people, work for the interests of the people and seek
                                liberation for all mankind.</p>
                            <p>The salvos of the October Revolution brought Marxism-Leninism to China. When the
                                Communist Party of China was founded in July 1921, Marxism-Leninism was written on its
                                flag as the theoretical basis for the Party's guiding ideology. In the early days of the
                                Communist Party of China, the party's original aspiration and mission set as its goal
                                the overthrow of the oppression of the "three mountains" of imperialism, feudalism and
                                bureaucrat-capitalism, the pursuit of national independence and liberation of the
                                people, and the establishment of a better society in which no one exploits others.</p>
                            <h2>2. The Party's original mission after the founding of New China</h2>
                            <p>After the founding of new China, the first important thing was to restore the economy,
                                and the CPC shifted its focus from the revolutionary war to economic construction. In
                                1953, MAO Zedong accurately stated the Party's general line for the transitional period
                                as follows: "This is a transitional period from the founding of the People's Republic of
                                China to the basic completion of socialist transformation. The general line and task of
                                the Party in this transitional period is to basically realize the industrialization of
                                the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts and capitalist
                                industry and commerce within a fairly long period of time." By the end of 1956, China
                                had basically completed the socialist transformation of ownership of the means of
                                production, realized the transformation from a new democratic society to a socialist
                                society, and established the socialist system. In March 1958, comrade MAO zedong put
                                forward "going all out, aim high, multiple construction economically socialism" of the
                                general line, and in May 1958, eight second meeting of the communist party of China
                                formally approved the route is based on the party's main task, based on the accurate
                                judgment, reflects people's urgent requirement changes the backwardness of economy and
                                culture in our country's common wish. Between 1949 and 1978, the Communist Party of
                                China led and united the people of all ethnic groups in China in initially meeting the
                                basic needs of the Chinese, who account for one quarter of the world's population, such
                                as food and clothing.</p>
                            <p>After the founding of new China, the Original aspiration and mission of the Party was to
                                fully restore the economy, establish the basic socialist system, and fundamentally
                                resolve the situation that the New China was in a state of complete ruin. Represented by
                                comrade MAO zedong the communist party of China led the people across the country for
                                the country prosperous, people's happiness and make unremitting struggle, established
                                the basic system of socialism, has established the independent and relatively complete
                                industrial system and national economic system, the comprehensive construction
                                socialism, and historic great progress, people's material and cultural life level
                                gradually improve. The party's original theoretical achievements and great achievements
                                in socialist revolution and development have provided valuable experience, theoretical
                                preparation and material foundation for starting socialism with Chinese characteristics
                                in the new historical period.</p>
                            <h2>3.The Party's original mission in the reform and opening up period</h2>
                            <p>The construction and development of socialism in China is an unprecedented great cause.
                                Although great achievements have been made, setbacks have also been encountered and
                                detours have been taken. In December 1977, Deng Xiaoping met with The Chairman of the
                                Communist Party of Australia, Mrs. Hill and His wife, and said, "What is superiority? Do
                                not work, do not study called superiority? Is the people's living standard backward
                                rather than improved called superiority? If this is called the superiority of socialism,
                                we can not have such socialism." During an inspection tour of the three northeastern
                                provinces in September 1978, Deng Xiaoping said, "We need to think about how much we
                                have done for the people." "We are too poor, too backward and frankly sorry to the
                                people." In December 1978, Deng Xiaoping made a speech at the closing meeting of the
                                Central Work Conference, saying, "If we do not carry out reform now, our cause of
                                modernization and socialism will be buried." The CPC Central Committee with Comrade Deng
                                Xiaoping at its core has pursued reform and opening up in all respects, proceeding from
                                reality, the basic national conditions in the primary stage of socialism, and the
                                fundamental interests of the Chinese people and nation. Reform and opening up have
                                greatly stimulated the creativity of the people, unleashed and developed the productive
                                forces, and boosted the vitality of social development. The people's living standards
                                have significantly improved, China's overall national strength has increased and its
                                international standing has risen significantly. China has gone through the modernization
                                process that some countries have gone through in more than 100 years or even longer.
                                From 1978 to 2012, China made remarkable achievements in its socialist modernization
                                drive. China's economy grew at an average annual rate of 9.8%, much higher than the 6.1%
                                annual rate between 1953 and 1978 before the reform and opening up and more than three
                                times the average annual rate of the world economy during the same period.</p>
                            <p>During the period of reform and opening up, the original aspiration and mission of the
                                CPC was to remove all ideological and institutional obstacles impeding the development
                                of the country and the nation, and to unite and lead the people in carrying out the
                                great new revolution of reform and opening up. Comrade deng xiaoping as the main
                                representative of the unity of the communist party of China led the whole party and the
                                Chinese people of all ethnic groups to emancipate the mind, seeking truth from facts,
                                and by the third plenary session, completely abandoned the error of "taking class
                                struggle as key link", the party and the country focus shifted to economic construction,
                                has made the major decision of China's reform and opening-up, determines the basic line
                                in the new period, This enabled China to realize a historical transition from a highly
                                centralized planned economy to a dynamic socialist market economy, and from a closed and
                                semi-closed economy to all-round opening-up. We thoroughly revealed the nature of
                                socialism, determined the basic line for the primary stage of socialism, made it clear
                                that we should go our own way and build socialism with Chinese characteristics,
                                scientifically answered a series of basic questions and development strategies for
                                building socialism with Chinese characteristics, and succeeded in creating socialism
                                with Chinese characteristics.</p>
                            <h2>4. The Party's original mission in the New Era</h2>
                            <p>Since the eighteenth congress, the party central committee with comrade xi as the core to
                                bear the mission of great political courage and strong, the new strategy, and put
                                forward a series of new concepts, new ideas from "two one hundred" goal to "Chinese
                                dream", from "five one" general layout as a whole to coordinate advances the strategy of
                                "four comprehensive" layout, From grasping the new normal of China's economic
                                development to firmly establishing five development concepts. General Secretary Xi
                                Jinping said, "Reform is only ongoing, but never completed. Stick to one blueprint."
                                "The people's aspiration for a better life is our goal." In under the leadership of the
                                party central committee with comrade xi for the core of economic development made
                                significant achievements, major breakthroughs were made in deepening reform in an
                                all-round way, major progress was made in democratic legal construction, major progress
                                was made in ideological and cultural construction, people's living standards continue to
                                improve, effective ecological civilization construction, army and army create a new
                                situation, new progress was made in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan to work. We deepened
                                all-round diplomacy, and made remarkable progress in comprehensively governing the Party
                                with strict discipline. The achievements made since the 18th National Congress of the
                                CPC are all-directional and ground-breaking, and the changes are deep-seated and
                                fundamental. We have solved many difficult problems that had long been on the agenda but
                                never were, accomplished many big things that had been on the agenda but never were, and
                                brought about historic changes in the cause of the Party and the country. In 2019,
                                China's GDP was about 14.343 trillion US dollars, accounting for 16.34 percent of the
                                global total. China's per capita GDP exceeded 10,000 US dollars for the first time.
                                According to the 2019 Statistical Communique of the National Bureau of Statistics on
                                National Economic and Social Development, the Engel coefficient of Chinese residents
                                stood at 28.2 percent, declining for eight consecutive years. During the 13th Five-Year
                                Plan period, more than 50 million rural poor people were lifted out of absolute poverty,
                                and the per capita net income of registered poor people increased from 5,124 yuan in
                                2016 to 9,057 yuan in 2019, an average annual increase of 30 percent. The number of
                                people living in poverty in China's rural areas dropped from 98.99 million at the end of
                                2012 to 5.51 million at the end of 2019, and the poverty incidence rate dropped from
                                10.2 percent to 0.6 percent. Overall regional poverty has been basically resolved. Over
                                the past 40 years, China has reduced the number of people living in poverty by more than
                                700 million, contributing over 70% to global poverty reduction, and being the first
                                country to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals. After the final victory in the
                                battle against poverty by the end of 2020, China will achieve the poverty reduction
                                target set in the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development 10 years ahead of schedule.

                            <p>General Secretary Xi Jinping pointed out in his report to the 19th National Congress of
                                the Communist Party of China, "If we remain true to why we started out, we will always
                                be successful. The original aspiration and the mission of Chinese Communists is to seek
                                happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation. This original
                                aspiration and mission is the fundamental driving force that inspires Chinese Communists
                                to keep moving forward." The nearly 100-year history of the COMMUNIST Party of China
                                fully proves that our Party has shouldered the two major historical tasks of achieving
                                national independence, liberation of the people, prosperity of the country and happiness
                                of the people. The difference is that the original aspiration and mission of the Party
                                have different historical connotations in different historical periods. We must keep in
                                mind the instructions of General Secretary Xi Jinping: "When we move forward, we must
                                not forget the road we have traveled. No matter how far we go and how bright the future
                                may be, we should never forget the past and why we set out. Facing the future and facing
                                challenges, all Party members must remain true to their original aspiration and continue
                                to forge ahead." "Today, we are closer to the goal of the great rejuvenation of the
                                Chinese nation than in any other period in history, and we are more confident and
                                capable of achieving this goal than in any other period in history." We should earnestly
                                practice "don't forget the beginner's mind, keep in mind that the mission", abide by the
                                constitution, abide by the party's nature and purpose, insist on a communist broad ideal
                                and the common ideal of socialism with Chinese characteristics condense the whole party
                                and unite the people, with xi jinping, new era thought arm the whole party, the
                                education of the people's socialism with Chinese characteristics, together with the
                                people forever, We will always share a common destiny with the people and work
                                tirelessly for their interests.</p>
