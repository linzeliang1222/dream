                                        developing countries have lent their full support to China during its difficult
                                        time. China has also actively helped some developing countries with weak public
                                        health systems strengthen their defense against the epidemic, and called on the
                                        international community to provide more material, technical and human support to
                                        developing countries, especially African countries. Within two years and
                                        promised to countries affected by the epidemic, especially in the developing
                                        countries to provide $2 billion aid, to establish hospital 30 African

                                        a number of major initiatives. Sharing weal and woe, China's friendship with
                                        other developing countries brings warmth and strength to all.</p>

                                <h3>Report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China:</h3>
                                <div style="text-indent: 2em;">
                                    <p>
                                        First, the report of the 19th CPC National Congress has defined international
                                        relations in a new way. Promoting a new type of international relations
                                        featuring mutual respect, fairness, justice and win-win cooperation.。
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Second, he made a dichotomous scientific judgment on the international situation.
                                        While acknowledging the irreversible trend of peaceful development, it also
                                        pointed out the common challenges facing mankind. The world we live in is full
                                        of both hope and challenges. We can't give up on our dreams because the reality
                                        is complicated, and we can't give up on our dreams because they are far away. No
                                        country can meet the challenges facing humanity alone, and no country can
                                        retreat into isolation.</p>
                                    <a href="http://xitheory.china.com.cn/2021-08/26/content_77715014.html"
                                       class="cover img-light" target="_blank">
                                        <img src="../../image/img8.jpg"
                                             style="width:650px;hight: 400px; padding: 10px 0;" alt="img reload fail">

                                    <p>Third, we should propose a strategy for building a community with a shared future
                                        for mankind. The dream of the Chinese people is closely connected with the dream
                                        of the people of other countries. To realize the Chinese dream, we cannot do
                                        without a peaceful international environment and a stable international order.
                                        China is very responsible in safeguarding the international order. This is
                                        China's basic position and choice. We must bear in mind both our domestic and
                                        international interests, unswervingly follow the path of peaceful development,
                                        pursue a win-win strategy of opening-up, uphold the right approach to justice
                                        and shared interests, and foster a new concept of common, comprehensive,
                                        cooperative and sustainable security. The report also proposes to establish a
                                        correct view of civilization and ecology.</p>
                                    <p>China is a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a
                                        defender of the international order.</p>
                                    <p>Fourth, reaffirm China's independent foreign policy of peace and give it new
                                        meaning. This new connotation covers at least two aspects. First, it puts
                                        special emphasis on upholding international fairness and justice, including the
                                        new type of international relations. China's development poses no threat to
                                        anyone. No matter how developed It may become, China will never seek hegemony or
                                        expand. This is a solemn commitment that has given new meaning to China's
                                        independent foreign policy of peace.</p>
                                    <p>Fifth, China needs to develop global partnerships. China will promote the
                                        building of a new model of major-country relations, uphold the right approach to
                                        justice and shared interests, and promote partnerships with other developing
                                        countries. By making a community of shared future for mankind take root in our
                                        neighborhood, we can build friendship and partnership with our neighbors.</p>
                                    <p>Sixth, China needs to pursue development with its door open. We need to advance
                                        the Belt and Road Initiative in all respects, build a new platform for
                                        international cooperation, and build an open world economy. There are some
                                        counter-currents in the international community. Anti-globalization and even
                                        so-called isolationism are not desirable. We will continue to open up and
                                        develop.</p>
