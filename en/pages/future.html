                        <p>
                            Occasionally I think about who we want to be in 10 years, in 20 years, and what we can bring
                            to society.
                            I think I should contribute my strength in more fields. As I continue to grow up and have a
                            deeper understanding of public welfare, I am increasingly aware that the strength of one
                            person can only help a small number of people, while the strength of a group of people can
                            make the world a better place. We may not be able to predict what kind of world these
                            efforts will eventually make, but at least we have made today a better place than
                            yesterday.</p>
                        <p>
                            Today's topic is "The Next Decade". In the next decade, the younger generation will also
                            become the backbone of society. I want more people to hear our voices in more areas. We were
                            born in an era when the country was prosperous and advanced in science and technology. But
                            we also have our own sense of mission, and we want to do our best to do something for
                            society. Although we have just dealt with this era, perhaps our voice is a little young, but
                            we are warm enough. I think creativity is something that our generation can present to you
                            in the next decade, which may sound grand, but it's not fantastic. We have confidence to
                            become more creative youth, this confidence comes from our open world, from the tolerance of
                            diversified life, but also from the strong motherland to bring us confidence.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the coming decade, China will play an even more important role on the world stage, and
                            our younger generation will also be an important force in this role. We are ready to do our
                            part. In the next 10 years, we will fight our way through all the difficulties and let the
                            voice of our youth be heard loudest in this era.

                                He revealed that to become an astronaut to go through extremely cruel "devil training",
                                that is a human physiology, psychology and will of the ultimate challenge, not ordinary
                                people can bear. Recalling how he felt when he went into space in 2003, Yang said, "I
                                flew alone in space, but I knew I was not fighting alone. At this moment, I represent
                                all Chinese people. What I saw proved the success of China's space technology. In the
                                next decade, China's space industry will enter a magnificent new era, and our goal is
                                the sea of stars."</p>
                            <p>Mountaineering hero Xia Boyu tells of his indisicable connection with Mount Qomolangma.
                                1975 was a "year of change" for Xia boyu: he lost his father, his legs, and Everest
                                became a distant dream. But life never knocked him down. Forty-three years later, at the
                                age of 69, Xia finally stood on the summit of Mount Qomolangma, more than 8,800 meters
                                high, achieving his "moment of glory". Speaking on the Power Up stage, he said:
                                "Everest, I want to thank it. It is the dream of climbing Mount Qomolangma that has
                                supported and inspired me so far that makes my life richer, more meaningful and worth
                                remembering." Xia said his next dream is "7+2" -- the highest peaks on the seven
                                continents and the North and South Poles.</p>
                            <p>Olympic champion Deng Yaping created a memory of The Times that belongs to every Chinese.
                                On stage in the Next Decade, she shared the hardships behind the glory. Because of her
                                short stature, Deng Yaping was not favored in the provincial team and the national team.
                                Facing criticism, she told herself at that time, "In terms of sports performance, I am
                                no worse than anyone else. Why can't I get into the provincial team when everyone else
                                can? I had to prove I was the stuff." As for the future development of sports, she said,
                                "No matter what time the older generation left behind, the perseverance and hard work
                                should never be lost; We should never forget the fighting spirit of the older
                                generation."</p>
                            <p>Director Tang Jili shared the story of Chinese films breaking through and going global.
                                "We already have the ability to compete with the North American film market, and now we
                                have the strength and confidence to recruit global talent," he said. We are willing to
                                be the 'vanguard' of Chinese film, shoulder heavy responsibilities and continue to
                                contribute to the development of Chinese film."</p>
                            <p>Jackson Yi, a young singer and actor, rose to fame at an early age and had a very
                                different upbringing. He gradually found his own direction in his packed schedule. He
                                believes that it is more important to see what one thinks of oneself than what others
                                expect. "We millennials are going to be the protagonists of the world," he said. I'm
                                here today not only for my voice, but for the voice of millennials, and I want our
                                voices to be heard in more areas. Though we have just come to grips with this age, our
                                voice may be a little young, but it is warm enough."</p>
                            <p>Song Xi, a post-90s student at Peking University, shared her "rebellious" but unyielding
                                story. From signing up for the army without telling their parents, to the gulf of Aden
                                rescue comrades, eat no matter how hard did not shrink back. On the stage, she told us
                                firmly: "The post-90s generation is not the defeated generation. The post-90s generation
                                is about to take on the responsibility of the country, society and family. The post-90s
                                generation is unyielding and never satisfied with the status quo." In the next decade,
                                the post-90s generation will be in their thirties and forties. She is still willing to
                                love the world in her own way, "rebellious" but responsible, willing to fight for her
                                dream, occasionally "sad" but "burning" all the way to embrace the next decade.</p>
                            <p>The past decade has witnessed the rebirth of the Chinese Women's Volleyball Team. The
                                spirit of unity, cooperation and intreptitude has been passed down from generation to
                                generation. Hui Ruoqi, a former Chinese women's volleyball player who won the world
                                championship with the team, shared the story behind the road to champion, which is the
                                battle against illness and the persistence of dreams. She said that in the next decade,
                                she will also pass on this spirit to the next generation, sowing the seeds of dreams
                                across the country.</p>
                            <p>Lilang men's wear brand director Wang Junhong tells the story of lilang men's wear in the
                                past 30 years of ups and downs and glory. "Lilang people are not afraid anymore," he
                                said, in the face of the current and future upheavals. Because we know that if there is
                                a shadow in front of us, there is sunshine behind us. Lilang always believes that in the
                                next ten years, domestic goods confidence; Over the next decade, China will define its
                                own vision of success globally; In the next decade, Made in China will become the pride
                                of the world."</p>
                            <p>Taobao anchor Weiya told about the development of the Internet today, Taobao live outside
                                the country to go to the poorest corner of China, so that global consumers enjoy the
                                convenience brought by the Internet era. Looking ahead to the future, she said:
                                "E-commerce livestreaming is only six years old, or imaginary. For such a small child,
                                it is understandable that some things are not done well. I hope you will give it time
                                and correct guidance so that it can thrive and truly become an upward force in China in
                                the future."</p>
                            <p>Bian Ning, an automotive engineer, talked about the development of driverless technology.
                                Speaking on the power Up stage, he said: "AS I stand here today, I am very excited.
                                China may be late to the game, but it has never been absent. I believe that the future
                                of the auto industry, the future of China, there is a lot to be done!"</p>
                            <p>What will China's economy look like in the next decade? Chuyin, a professor from the
                                University of International Relations, made his own judgment from three perspectives:
                                the positive effect of China's technological development on the market scale, the
                                continuous improvement of China's urbanization and commercialization level, and the new
                                demand constantly generated in the consumption field. He believed that "the next ten or
                                twenty years will be dominated by the Oriental chopstick culture circle".</p>
                            <p>Young actress Shen Yue told about the pressure behind her fame. After appearing in Meteor
                                Garden, the public questioned her acting skills and body shape, which she could not
                                forget, but she said, "Actors speak by their works. How much you put in behind you and
                                how much effort you have made are reflected in your works. You can't lower your
                                standards just because you're not in class. I haven't seen the blossom yet in my choice
                                of actor. I'm still in a stage of self-confrontation and struggle, with both pleasure
                                and pain."</p>
                            <p>Presenter Martin tells the story of a doctor's professional faith, he said, "we have been
                                a step forward, in the next decade, no matter how bitter more tired and medical staff
                                will be more respected and protected, more to admire, there will be more and more young
                                people are more willing to join in, health care workers in the heart, noble profession
                                spirit will become more strong, more secure."</p>
                            <p>This is a great new era. In the next decade, digital economy, smart community, big data,
                                Internet of things... The possibilities are endless for us to try; This is a new era of
                                endeavor. In the coming decade, we will not be afraid of wind and rain, nor of dangers,
                                no matter whether it is calm or turbulent. In the coming decade, we will seize the day,
                                live up to our youth, write the future with sweat, and make the era a success with our
