                            "Young people should shoulder the historical mission, forge ahead with confidence, set high aspirations, be bright and virtuous, become talented and shoulder great responsibilities, and strive to become a new generation worthy of the task of national rejuvenation. Let them blossom in their unremitting efforts for the motherland, the nation, the people and mankind."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the 18th NATIONAL Congress of the CPC, the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping at its core has taken a strategic position of ensuring that the cause of the Party and the people is passed on from generation to generation, and has lovingly cared for the growth and success of young people, charting the way forward for youth work in the new era.
                            A series of important statements on youth work issued by General Secretary Xi Jinping have lofty ideas, rich connotations and profound thoughts. They have clarified major theoretical and practical issues concerning youth work in the new situation and pointed out the historical mission and growth path of contemporary youth.
                            To accurately grasp the basic requirements and key tasks of youth work, and guide young people to have lofty ideals, love the great motherland, shoulder the responsibilities of The Times, have the courage to work hard, hone their skills, and temper their moral integrity,
                            It is of great significance to encourage and mobilize young people to study hard and work hard to achieve the "Two Centenary Goals" and realize the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation.
